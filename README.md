Google Passport Example
========================

This app is a building block for using Google OAuth 2.0 using [passport-google-oauth20](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth2).

## Getting set up
You will need to create a project on Google, and enable this project to 
do OAuth 2.0 login.  As part of this process you will:

Give Google the URLs of this app, and of an intermediate route which it will use in the login process

Get a client ID and secret (these are like the API keys), and add them in the `.env` file.
