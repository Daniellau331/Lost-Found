ECS 162 Project\

We meet almost all the requirements:
1. not UCDavis email can't login and give error message
2. create db
3. send image to ecs162 server
4. select column from db by certain condition
5. transfer search data from db into mulptile tags in result page
6. google map issues

But when we try to redirect after clicking "submit" button, there are some strange errors presenting  pages to result page.
The finder's search button works fine if you want to test it.
We really try very hard to achieve those goals, please take a look at our code. The only problem is the strange behaviour from one page to another page.
