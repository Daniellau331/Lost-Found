Twitter Passport Example
========================

This app is a building block for using Twitter OAuth using [passport-twitter](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-twitter). You will need to [create a Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) to obtain the keys for the `.env` variables.

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
